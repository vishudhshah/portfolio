    <h1>Vishudh Shah</h1>

    <p>
        I am an undergraduate at the University of California San Diego, pursuing a dual degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science.
        With a strong foundation in these disciplines, I am a detail-oriented and self-driven individual passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems.
        My academic journey and hands-on experience have equipped me with expertise in AI frameworks, data analytics, and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Proficient in Python and C++, I have successfully developed impactful tools and conducted research during internships at VTION Digital, Georgia State University, and Godrej Consumer Products Limited.
        I thrive on innovation, problem-solving, and applying technical knowledge to deliver effective solutions.
        Beyond academics, I have honed my teamwork and collaboration skills through active involvement in academic societies and community outreach initiatives, reflecting my commitment to both professional growth and societal impact.
